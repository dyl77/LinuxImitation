# Linux Directory Imitation

This is a simple program designed to mimic a simplified version of a linux style file directory.
This program uses traditional, and custom commands found in the linux environment.
You will start with a blank command line, where you should start with creating a directory or file. Do this by using the command mkdir (name) or addf (name).
Information on usage and documentation will be inserted here when availible.
